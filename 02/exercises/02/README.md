### Exercise no. 2.02

Consider the following program:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
    printf("fill the time\n");
    printf("available for its completion.\n");
    return 0;
}
```
(a) Identify the directives and statements in this program.
(b) What output does the program produce?

## Solutions

(a) The directives would be ```#include<stdio.h>``` 
The rest of the code would be statements from ```int main(void)``` till ```return 0``` statement 

(b) the output is:
```
Parkinson's Law:
 Work expands so as tofill the time
 available for its completion.
```
